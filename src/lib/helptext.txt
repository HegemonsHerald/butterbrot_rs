  butterbrot [ARGUMENTS]


POSSIBLE FLAGS AND WHAT THEY MEAN:

  h, --help
        Display this help text.

  -o, --filename <filename>
        The filename to write the computed data to. This will be a birb file.

        Default: birb_{rand}.birb, where {rand} will be turned into a random
        string, to insure the file is available.

  -t, --threads <number>
        How many threads to use for parallel computation. Note, that this is the
        number of computation threads. The total number of threads is one
        larger, as this doesn't include the main thread.  This works better, if
        the total number of threads doesn't exceed the number of available
        cores.

        Default: 7

  -to, --timeout <seconds>
        How many whole seconds to run AT MINIMUM, before the program terminates
        the computation. Note, that the program will finish some time after the
        timeout has been reached, as each thread will finish the currently
        active computation before returning.
        If no timeout is specified this value will be set to the larges possible
        unsigned 64-Bit integer, a number of seconds, that is unlikely to be
        reached, while computation is active.

  -w, --width <number>
        How wide to make the birb.

        Default: 100

  -h, --height <number>
        How tall to make the birb.

        Default: 100

  -w, --warmup <number>
        How many samples should the Metropolis-Hastings Iterators discard as
        warmup. See documentation for more.

        Default: 1000

  -s, --samples <number>
        How many samples should the program compute in total, across all
        threads. This does not include the warmup.

        Default: 10000

  -i, --iterations <number>
        How many iterations long should each Orbit be at max. See documentation
        for more.

        Default: 100

  -c1, --complex1 <real> <imaginairy>
        One of the corners of the frame of the Complex Plane that is to be
        explored. This must be a diagonally opposite corner to --complex1.
        The real and imaginairy parts must be floats.

        Default: -2.0 -2.0

  -c2, --complex2 <real> <imaginairy>
        One of the corners of the frame of the Complex Plane that is to be
        explored. This must be a diagonally opposite corner to --complex1.
        The real and imaginairy parts must be floats.

        Default: 2.0 2.0
