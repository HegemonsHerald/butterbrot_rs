/// Outputs logging information about the state of the threads handled by `butterbrot_run`
///
/// ### What this does
/// This function sporadically composes and prints a log with the computation's state based on
/// status info it gets from the computation threads via an `mpsc` channel. The computation threads
/// send a pair with their unique index and the number of samples, their iterator has left to do.
/// Whenever `logging()` has gotten such a pair for each of the threads, it will output a log
/// message. It always waits, til it has received at least one message from all threads, so the log
/// will be complete.  
/// If the threads are enough out of sync, that a thread sends multiple messages, while another
/// hasn't send any, only the newest message will be kept.
///
/// There are some special behaviours to keep in mind. `logging()` returns when all threads have
/// finished, that is, have 0 samples left to compute.  
/// `logging()` returns an `mpsc::Receiver<(i32,i32)>`. There's a good reason for that, if a
/// custom timeout has been specified and the timeout is reached, `logging()` will almost certainly
/// return quite a while *before* the computation threads notice, that the timeout has been
/// reached. After all the computation threads will finish their current cycle, before re-checking,
/// so that, even though the timeout generally is respected, no data can be lost or mal-formed.
/// That also means, that the threads will attempt to send their last pair of logging data after
/// `logging()` already died. In order not to get an unecessary `panic!` from that, `logging()`
/// simply returns its end of the channel and expects the calling thread (main) to keep that
/// `Receiver` alive long enough, for the computation threads to `join()`.
///
/// ### Parameters
/// There's really nothing much to explain there. `timestamp` should be the `Instant` when the
/// computation was started, so the `timestamp` variable made by `butterbrot_run` right before it
/// starts creating threads. All the others are pretty obviously named...
