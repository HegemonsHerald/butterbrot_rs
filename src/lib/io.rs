/// Macro to help with parsing command line arguments.
///
/// ### What does this do?
///
/// This Macro has four rules:
///
/// 1. Complex Numbers: `parse!("-c1", args, complex)`
/// 2. Strings: `parse!("--filename", args, string)`
/// 3. Primitives: `parse!("--width", args, u64)`
/// 4. Parse Errors: `parse!(unmatched, error)`
///
/// The three first variants take a token `&str`, which should be the name of the command line
/// flag, that is currently being parsed. (For error output)
///
/// The second argument is an Iterator, that produces the arguments in order, so the Macro has
/// access to the Flag's arguments. **This must be an Iterator over Strings!**
///
/// The third argument specifies the operating mode.
///
/// If it's `complex` the Macro will attempt to get the next two items from the `args` iterator and
/// parse them as `f64`.
///
/// If it's `string` the Macro will attempt to get the next item from iterator and simply yields it
/// as a `String`.
///
/// If it's some primitive type, the Macro will attempt to get the next item from the iterator and
/// parse it as the specified primitive type using `&str.parse::<TYPE>()`.
///
/// If any of these operations fail a custom error message is displayed and the application
/// **panics**.
///
/// The fourth variant is especially for dealing with unmatched command line flags. See the example
/// below.
///
/// ### Usage Example (Why should I care?)
///
/// **Note: I didn't actually test these code snippets.**  
/// **Note:* The `math::Complex` type is part of *my* `butterbrot_rs` crate, for which I made this
/// Macro.
///
/// ```
/// let args_v: Vec<String> = std::env::args().collect();
/// let args = args_v.into_iter();
///
/// // output is for config:
/// // (width, height, math::Complex( real, imaginairy ), filename)
/// let mut output = (0i32, 0i32, math::Complex::new(88.9, 72.4), "file.name".to_string());
///
/// let mut curr:String;
/// loop {
///
///     match args.next() {
///         Some(s) => curr = s,
///         None    => break,
///     }
///
///     match curr.as_ref() {
///
///         "-w" || "--width"  => { output.0 = parse!("--width",    args, i32) },
///         "-h" || "--height" => { output.1 = parse!("--height",   args, i32) },
///         "--filename"       => { output.3 = parse!("--filename", args, string) },
///         "--complex"        => { output.2 = parse!("--complex",  args, complex) },
///
///         // print an error with the flag the parsing failed on
///         unmatched_flag => { parse!(unmatched_flag, error) },
///
///     }
///
/// }

/// parses command line arguments
///
/// This function has a hard-coded set of CLI-args it knows. It will linearly iterate over the list
/// of user-provided arguments and parse them, as it goes along. It will gracefully `panic!` with a
/// customised and even somewhat helpful error message, thanks to the `parse!` macro.
///
/// There's one curious thing to consider: If a flag takes multiple arguments and the user didn't
/// provide enough, but instead wrote another flag, this function will treat that flag as the
/// argument to the previous flag and (*probably*) get a parse error there. That means one has to
/// be slightly careful with flags and their order, and if parameters aren't provided, this ain't
/// gonna fly... The `parse!` macro will output, that an argument is missing, if the flag is at the
/// end of the list.
///
/// This function returns a tuple with this structure:
/// ```
/// (   (width, height),
///     (complex1, complex2),
///     filename,
///     thread count,
///     (samples, iterations, warmup),
///     timeout
/// )
/// ```
/// For what these mean, see the helptext and the docs of `butterbrot_run` (which takes most of
/// these numbers as arguments).
///
/// If a flag isn't provided, default values are used in its place.
///
///
/// **Note:** This function is written specifically for this project, but it can easily be adapted
/// for other projects, that only require primitive command-line facilities. Simply overwrite the
/// type declaration and the defaults for the `output` variable, then use the type declaration of
/// output as the return value of the function. Lastly change the `match` against the flags to suit
/// the project's needs and adapt the `parse!` macro to reflect the new parsing needs (that
/// shouldn't be hard: take out the bit about `math::Complex`, and add whatever rules and variants
/// of rules you need and you're good to go), and this should be fine. Piece of cake.
