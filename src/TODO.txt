THE birb2bmp TOOL
=================

  - load a birb from file <- args_parser variant
  - split it into thread slices <- unsafe
  - find the largest number from the birb in parallel

  - what's the best approach to create the bitmap...?
     - single threadedly just compute
     - multi threaded: replace all the numbers in the birb with their 256 mapped counterparts?, then either use linear write or a mutex or something...
     - multi threaded: separate tinier bitmaps to merge into one larger one?    <- Can you do that?
     - multi threaded: one large bitmap with unsafe mutable concurrent slicing? <- Can you do that? This would be the BEST
